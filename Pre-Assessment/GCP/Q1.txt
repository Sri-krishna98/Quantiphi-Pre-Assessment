Steps to create VPC and subnets
Create network
# We are using custom mode networking which has no subnets created by default
gcloud compute networks create NETWORK_NAME \
  --subnet-mode=custom \
  --bgp-routing-mode=DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE  

# where NETWORK_NAME is a name for the VPC network and
# DYNAMIC_ROUTING_MODE can be either global or regional
Creating subnet:
gcloud compute networks subnets create SUBNET_NAME \
  --network=NETWORK \
  --range=PRIMARY_RANGE \
  --region=REGION
  
# where SUBNET_NAME is a name for the new subnet.
# NETWORK is the name of the VPC network that will contain the new subnet.
# PRIMARY_RANGE is the primary IP range for the new subnet, in CIDR notation.
# REGION is the Google Cloud region in which the new subnet will be created.
